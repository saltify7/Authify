## UI
- compare responses widget (diff) with synced scrolling
- HTTPQL config

## LOGIC
- drop requests (if possible to intercept, resend and drop)
- automatic cookie and auth header extraction from modified responses

## PERFORMANCE
- allow table limit to be customised (set to 500 rows for now)

## BUGS
- send to replay - keep HTTP/HTTPS (defaults to https for now)
