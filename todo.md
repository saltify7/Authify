## UI
- compare responses widget (diff) with synced scrolling
- colour-code methods in table?

## LOGIC
- drop requests (if possible to intercept, resend and drop)
    - not traditionally possible due to request sdk being asynchronous - might be possible via some kind of M&R?
- hotkey for switching between original and modified
-"remove headers" option in addition to M&R

## PERFORMANCE
- allow table limit to be customised (set to 500 rows for now)

## BUGS
- send to replay - keep HTTP/HTTPS (defaults to https for now)
